The first [CoreOS Fest](https://coreos.com/fest) was quite the event!  A big thanks to the CoreOS team for putting on an impressive first conference.  

The [speaker lineup](https://coreos.com/fest/speakers/#tabs) was amazing and I was honored to be a part of it.  I really enjoyed sharing some of the lessions we've learned building platforms on top of CoreOS.  In case you missed it [here are the slides](http://gabrtv.github.io/10-lessons-learned-using-coreos/#/).

Looking forward to next year!
