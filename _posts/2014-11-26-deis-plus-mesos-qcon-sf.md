![Gabriel Monroy, Deis CTO, speaking about Deis, Mesos and Cluster Schedulers](/assets/img/gabrtv_qcon_deis_mesos.jpg)

I'd like to thank [Chris Bednarski](https://twitter.com/cbednarski) and the QCon SF organizers for inviting me to speak on the [Deploying at Scale](http://qconsf.com/track/deploying-scale) track this year.

It was a terrific conference with a highly technical and engaged audience.  I had a lot of fun doing a deep dive into cluster schedulers and how Deis arrived at Mesos for deploying containers at scale.  

If you missed it, check out the slides for [Deis + Mesos: Docker PaaS at Scale](http://gabrtv.github.io/deis-qconsf-2014/#/).
