![Chris Armstrong talking about containerized Ceph in Deis](/assets/img/armstrong_cephdays.jpg)

Chris Armstrong, Deis team lead, recently spoke at [Ceph Day San Francisco](http://ceph.com/cephdays/ceph-day-san-francisco/) on how Deis uses [Ceph](http://ceph.com/), including pointers for running Ceph in containers.

Deis is highly available thanks to Ceph, and it was a pleasure having the opportunity to give back to the Ceph community.
You can find the slides [here](http://carmstrong.github.io/ceph-days-sf-deis-2015).
