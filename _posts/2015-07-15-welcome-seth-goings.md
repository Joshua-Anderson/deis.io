Seth is a software engineer who has always despised how much time, effort, sweat,
and tears are involved in producing high quality software projects. He'd rather
spend time running away from snarling Chihuahuas, riding his bicycle off into
the sunset, cooking up an all-kitchen-appliances-necessary dinner, or remodeling
his house at 3AM than stepping through a testing spreadsheet
during "release night." Due to this drive, naturally he'll be working on
improving the build, test, and deployment infrastructure within the Deis project.

Seth lives in Colorado and will be working on Deis full time in Engine Yard's Boulder office.
