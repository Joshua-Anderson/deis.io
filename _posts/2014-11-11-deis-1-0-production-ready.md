The Deis project is proud to announce [v1.0.0](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases/tag/v1.0.0), our first stable release.  Deis is now suitable for production workloads.  This makes Deis the first production-ready PaaS built from the ground up to leverage Docker.

The 1.0 milestone signifies Deis has a stable API, broad feature set and solid component architecture.  The Deis 1.0 feature set includes:

 * **Platform Quality** - Deis has been battle-tested by the open source community to handle production enterprise workloads
 * **Streamlined Installation** - Deis can now be installed on a CoreOS cluster in under 30 minutes using a simple command-line utility
 * **High Availability** - The entire Deis platform is highly-available and can tolerate failure of any host in the cluster
 * **Proven Workflows** - Deis ships with three deployment workflows: Heroku Buildpacks, Dockerfiles and native Docker Images
 * **Comprehensive Documentation** - Docs for developers and operators have been expanded, improved and consolidated into a single documentation site
 * **Run Anywhere** â€“ Deis runs on public cloud, private cloud and bare metal with certified support for Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, OpenStack and VMware

We want to thank the extended community of Deis users and contributors, whose willingness to put early versions of Deis into production has allowed us to resolve issues that can only be found when running real-world production workloads.  We are grateful for your patience and persistence.

During the past 16 months of development, Deis has incorporated best-of-breed technologies from Docker, CoreOS, Ceph, Heroku and others.  We want to thank these projects/vendors and the wonderful people behind them.  Your ongoing assistance has been critical to the success of Deis as an open source PaaS.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## Known Issues

### Docker 1.3.1

Starting in Docker 1.3.1, TLS is now required for all registry communication (public or private).  While we are proponents of this in principle, the way it was rolled out has caused a range of issues for anyone using a private registry -- including Deis.  We are working hard to address this issue, but for now Deis only works with Docker 1.3.0.

### Logs on Upgrade

When upgrading from earlier Deis releases to v1.0+, it is possible to lose platform log data due to upgrading of Ceph components.  We are exploring workarounds, but for now we recommend following our [backup and restore process](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/backing_up_data/) to ensure you do not lose log data on upgrade.

## Future Plans

### Interactive Admin Commands

Although `deis run` executes individual admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support long-running interactions, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc.) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).
