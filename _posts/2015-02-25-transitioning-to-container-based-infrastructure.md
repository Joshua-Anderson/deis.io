Gabriel Monroy, Deis creator, recently spoke at a [Costanoa Venture Capital](http://costanoavc.com/) event on "Building at Web Scale"
along with [Adrian Cockroft (Netflix, Battery Ventures)](https://twitter.com/adrianco), [Nic Benders (New Relic)](https://twitter.com/nicbenders),
[Ruslan Belkin (RelateIQ)](https://twitter.com/ruslansv) and [Diogo MÃ³nica (Docker, Square)](https://twitter.com/diogomonica).

Since Deis was first released, we have helped hundreds of companies transition to container-based infrastructure.
We enjoyed sharing some of the best practices we picked up along the way.
You can find the slides [here](http://gabrtv.github.io/costanoa-containers-2014/#/).
